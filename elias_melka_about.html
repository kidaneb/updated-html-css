        Elias Melka Geresu is guitar by himself (Amharic: ኤሊያስ መልካ ገረሱ;(Oromo: Eliyaas Malkaa
        Garasuu) 10 December 1977 – 4 October 2019) was an Ethiopian record
        producer and songwriter. Elias became popular after successfully
        composing Teddy Afro's debut album Abugida, which was released in 2001.
        Elias has composed more than forty studio albums and has worked with
        many and the most influential singers in modern Ethiopian music history.
        Until his death on 4 October 2019, he had played a crucial role in the
        Ethiopian music industry.

        Elias was believed to be the first person to introduce the practice of
        studio music production in Ethiopia.] Some of the artists whose albums
        were composed by Elias are Teddy Afro, Gossaye Tesfaye, Mikaya Behailu,
        Eyob Mekonnen, Zeritu Kebede, Tigist Bekele, Haile Roots, Gete Anley,
        Berry, and Leul Hailu. Elias was also a leader in taking social
        responsibility, having produced more than half a dozen singles that deal
        with HIV/AIDS and traffic accidents and others. These songs made by
        himself and collaborated with others greatly helped the effort to
        educate people about these societal dangers.[2] From those, "Ashkerkir
        Rega Bileh" and "Mela Belu" are the priors.
